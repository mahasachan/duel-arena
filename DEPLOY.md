   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Enhanced Duel Arena"

   ```

   - Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Railway will auto-detect Node.js and deploy!
   - Get your URL: `https://yourproject.up.railway.app`

### Option 2: Render.com (Also Free)

1. **Push to GitHub** (same as above)

2. **Deploy on Render**
   - Go to [Render.com](https://render.com)

   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Use these settings:
     - **Build Command**: `npm install`
     - **Start Command**: `npm start`

### Option 3: Heroku

```bash
# Install Heroku CLI first

```

### Option 4: DigitalOcean App Platform

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to DigitalOcean → App Platform
3. Create app from GitHub repo
4. Set build command: `npm install`
5. Set run command: `npm start`

## Local Network Deployment (LAN)

If you want to play with friends on the same network:

```bash
# Find your local IP
ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{print $7; exit}'

# Start server
npm start

# Share this URL with friends on same network:
# http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3000
```

## Configuration for Production

The server automatically handles:
- ✅ CORS settings for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Static file serving
- ✅ WebSocket connections
- ✅ Production optimizations

## Testing Your Deployment

1. **Open your deployed URL**
2. **Enter a player name and join**
3. **Open the URL in another browser/device**
4. **Enter different player name**
5. **Watch them get matched for battle!**

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
- Check build logs for errors
- Ensure `package.json` has correct `start` script
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

### If WebSockets don't work:
- Most modern hosting platforms support WebSockets
- Check if the platform has specific WebSocket requirements

### If game doesn't load:
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all files are committed to git
- Verify the server is actually running
